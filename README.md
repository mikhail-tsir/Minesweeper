# Minesweeper
I recreated the traditional minesweeper game. I plan on experimenting with a bot that will solve minesweeper games automatically.
I used pygame for the visuals.  You can change the size of the board and the probability of bombs in the code.

# Snake
Re-created classic snake game in Java. This was done to brag/prove to a friend that I could make Snake in 20 minutes, hence the code is poorly written. I plan on optimizing the code and maybe making an AI which will learn to play Snake (although this seems a bit overdone).
